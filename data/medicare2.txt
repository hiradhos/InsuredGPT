What is Medicare Advantage?

Medicare Advantage, also known as Medicare Part C, is an alternative way to receive Medicare benefits. It is offered by private insurance companies approved by Medicare. Medicare Advantage plans combine the coverage of Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Part B (medical insurance), and often include additional benefits such as prescription drug coverage, dental, vision, and hearing services. These plans may also offer health and wellness programs. Medicare Advantage plans typically have provider networks, and beneficiaries are required to use in-network providers for most services. They may have different costs and rules compared to Original Medicare, but they must provide at least the same level of coverage. Medicare Advantage offers an alternative option for individuals who want additional benefits beyond what Original Medicare provides.

Pros of Medicare Advantage plans
Comprehensive coverage

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans offer comprehensive coverage that includes all the benefits of Original Medicare (Part A and Part B). In addition to these basic benefits, MA plans often provide extra coverage options that go beyond what Original Medicare offers. These additional benefits may include routine vision care, coverage for hearing aids, routine dental care, and prescription drug coverage. With Medicare Advantage, beneficiaries can enjoy the convenience of having their medical, hospital, and prescription drug needs all covered under one plan. These added benefits can be valuable for individuals who desire a more comprehensive healthcare package that addresses their specific needs.
Additional benefits

In addition to the coverage additions mentioned earlier, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans may offer a range of additional benefits that can enhance the overall healthcare experience for beneficiaries. These benefits can vary depending on the specific MA plan and insurance provider. Some common additional benefits include access to fitness center memberships, wellness programs, preventive services, and alternative therapies such as acupuncture or chiropractic care. One popular additional benefit is the inclusion of the SilverSneakers program, which provides access to fitness classes, exercise equipment, and social activities at participating gyms and fitness centers.

Furthermore, MA plans often operate as Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) or other managed care networks, which means beneficiaries are required to use a designated network of healthcare providers. This can result in coordinated and streamlined care, as well as potential cost savings. Some MA plans may also provide transportation services for medical appointments or offer telehealth options for remote consultations with healthcare professionals.

It’s important to note that the availability and extent of these additional benefits can vary between MA plans and insurance providers. Therefore, individuals considering Medicare Advantage should carefully review the details of each plan to understand the specific benefits and features they offer.
Cost savings

If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, you must continue to pay your Medicare Part B premiums and you may pay an additional premium. The insurer determines the Medicare Advantage plan’s premium, which can vary from one Medicare Advantage plan to another. Some Medicare Advantage plans may offer enrollees monthly premiums as low as $0.

Your cost sharing may also be less under Medicare Advantage. For, example, if an enrollee visits a primary care physician under Medicare Advantage, they may have a copayment of $10. However, if the enrollee visits a primary care physician under Original Medicare, they may have a coinsurance of 20%, which could be more than $10.

Also, a Medicare Advantage plan limits your maximum out-of-pocket expense. Once you have spent that maximum, you typically pay nothing for covered medical services for the remainder of the year. Original Medicare does not provide a maximum out-of-pocket cap, so potential expenses are limitless.

Often a Medicare Advantage plan can be less expensive than comparable coverage with Original Medicare. To get the most out of a Medicare Advantage plan with Original Medicare, you may also need to enroll in a stand-alone Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan as well as a Medicare Supplement Insurance plan.
Cons of Medicare Advantage plans
Limited provider network

With the federally administered Medicare program, enrollees can generally go to any doctor or facility that accepts Medicare and receive the same level of Medicare benefits for covered services. In contrast, Medicare Advantage plans may be more restricted in terms of their provider networks. If you go out of network, your plan may not cover the medical costs, or your costs may not apply to your out-of-pocket maximum.
Prior authorization requirements

Medicare Advantage plans try to prevent the misuse or overuse of health care through various means. This might include prior authorization for hospital stays, home health care, medical equipment, and certain complicated procedures. Medicare Advantage plans may also require your primary care doctor’s referral to see specialists before they will pay for services.
Potential out-of-pocket costs

Besides premiums and deductibles, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans may also involve potential out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries. These costs can vary depending on the specific MA plan, insurance provider, and the services received. Here are some example scenarios of when a beneficiary may encounter these potential out-of-pocket costs:

    Copayments: A beneficiary might have a copayment for each doctor’s visit or prescription drug they receive. For instance, they may be responsible for a $20 copayment for a primary care visit or a $10 copayment for generic medications.
    Coinsurance: In some cases, instead of a copayment, a beneficiary may have to pay a percentage of the cost of a service as coinsurance. For example, they may be responsible for 20% coinsurance for a specialist consultation or 25% coinsurance for durable medical equipment.
    Annual Deductibles: Many MA plans have an annual deductible that must be met before the plan starts covering certain services. For instance, a beneficiary may have a $500 deductible for hospital stays, meaning they must pay the first $500 of hospital costs before the plan begins covering the remaining expenses.
    Out-of-Network Costs: If a beneficiary receives care from a healthcare provider outside of the MA plan’s network, they may be subject to higher out-of-pocket costs. This can include higher copayments, coinsurance, or even being responsible for the full cost of the services received.
    Prescription Drug Costs: While most  MA (MA, also called Medicare Part C) plans include prescription drug coverage through Part D (Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plans), beneficiaries may still have out-of-pocket costs for medications. This can include copayments or coinsurance for different tiers of drugs, such as generic, preferred brand, or non-preferred brand medications.

It’s important for beneficiaries to review their specific MA plan’s summary of benefits and coverage to understand the details of their potential out-of-pocket costs. These costs can impact the overall affordability of the plan and should be considered when comparing different MA options.
